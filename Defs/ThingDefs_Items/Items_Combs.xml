    <label>temperate honeycomb</label>
    <description>This is a honeycomb produced by temperate bees. Temperate bees are the most common type of bee, descended from Earth's Apis Mellifera, the European Honey Bee. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey and beeswax.</description>

    <label>arctic honeycomb</label>
    <description>This is a honeycomb produced by icy bees. Icy bees have been genetically modified to operate at frigid temperatures. Their icy honeycombs can be used to extract honey and frost. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey and beeswax.</description>
