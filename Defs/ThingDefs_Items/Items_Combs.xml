    <defName>RB_Temperate_Honeycomb</defName>
    <label>temperate honeycomb</label>
    <description>This is a honeycomb produced by temperate bees. Temperate bees are the most common type of bee, descended from Earth's Apis Mellifera, the European Honey Bee. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey and beeswax.</description>

    <label>adaptive honeycomb</label>
    <description>This is a honeycomb produced by adaptive bees. Adaptive bees are not much affected by the conditions of the biome they are working in. as such, they can stand low and high temperatures a bit better, and they work very fast. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey and beeswax.</description>

    <label>technological honeycomb</label>
    <description>This is a honeycomb produced by technological bees. Technological bees are part bee, part machine. They can be further crossbred into bees that provide chemfuel, components, and other technological marvels. But more importantly, they produce Bio Interface Components, which are used to build advanced beehouses. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get beeswax and Bio Interface Components.</description>
